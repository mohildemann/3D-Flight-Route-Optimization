# 3DRouting
This is a short description of my Master Thesis, a 3D route optimization for air taxis with the multiple criteria "Shortest Flight Time", "Lowest Energy Consumption" and "Least Added Noise"

Requirements:
1. Install and get license for ArcGIS Pro (https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/install-and-sign-in-to-arcgis-pro.htm)
2. Set up your Python environment: You need Python 3.68 (Comes with ArcGIS Pro) 
3. Use the environment of ArcGIS Pro to run the main.py. For example, the environment for my installation is: "C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\python.exe"
